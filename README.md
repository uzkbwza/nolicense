NO LICENSE
=====

The full No License Non-License is a statement of intent, not a legally binding document. Software licenses, even those with the most noble of intentions, rely on the enforcement of copyright law. This means all legally recognized licenses are predicated on leveraging state power, thus violent coercion. The No License Non-License statement is a recognition and circumnavigation of state violence, an agreement between the author of the software and those who wish to use and distribute it without the threat of legal force.

You may use any variation of the No License Non-License statement. Here is the full, long-form variant, which conveys the absence of license and a suggestion ethic for distribution:

```
NO LICENSE

This software is released without a license.

Use, modify, or distribute it on the basis of mutual trust, not legal protection.
```

Alternatively, you may use this form, which lacks such opinion:

```
NO LICENSE

This software is released without a license.
```

Your non-license may contain different content if you like. Choosing to include no license file at all is an excellent way to distribute your software with No License. However, a non-license statement such as this one may clarify intentions regarding the distribution of your work.
